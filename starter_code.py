# or graph analysis, the function expects you to return the modified graph back.
# In the given example, we just print the graph, and then initilize the graph
# profiler. The graph profiler extends the class fx.Interpreter, that allows you

# We first initialize the model, pass it to the wrapper model, then create a
# random input mini-batch and initilize the optimizer. We then call the compile
# function that takes in two arguments, a train_step function and a
# graph_transformation function. The train_step function is the one that will be
# traced by the compiler and a computational graph for the same will be created.
# This computational graph is then passed to the graph_transformation function
# to do any graph profiling, modifications and optimizations. This modified
# graph is stored and will be returned as the compiled function. In essence we
# do the following inside the compile function:

# def compile (train_step, graph_transformation):
#     @wraps(train_step)
#     def inner(*args, **kwargs):
#         if not_compiled:
#             original_graph, input_args = graph_tracer(train_step)
